<div id="answer241" class="answer">Correct! Mass is the amount of matter in the body 
which does not depend on the value of g. Weight of a 
body is the gravitational force on it. Thus, weight is 
dependent on gravitational acceleration (g). 
Hence, weight of a body will change from one place to 
another place because the value of g is different in 
different places. As mass is independent of g, so it will 
not change from place to place.</div>
